              <h3>What Is Oily Skin?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>‘Oily’ is used to describe a skin type with heightened sebum
              production. An over production is known as seborrhea.
              <br />
              <br />
              Excessively oily, shiny skin can not only be embarrassing and
              troublesome, but too much oil can cause the sebaceous glands to
              clog up and become infected. This clogging up does lead to skin
              problems such as acne. blackheads, pimples or congested skin.
              <br />
              <br />
              Although oily skin can clog pores and lead to increased acne
              breakouts, oily skin also has many benefits. Oil helps preserve
              the skin, and people with oily skin tend to have thicker skin and
              fewer wrinkles. he key is to strike a balance between having too
              much oil and maintaining your skin’s natural moisture.</p>

                <p>
                  <br /> When cleansing oily skin, it is best to use a foaming
                  cleanser as it is most effective when removing dirt,
                  impurities and excess sebum.

                  They can be a little bit harsh since they’re made to slightly
                  dry out the skin, though some are formulated with oils or
                  emollients to provide a more moisturizing experience.

                <h2>Exfoliating</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> Exfoliation is one of the most important skincare steps
                  for oily skin. Oily skin tends to have an extra-thick coat of
                  built-up dead skin on the surface, along with a thickened pore
                  lining.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The best exfoliating ingredient for oily skin is salicylic
                  acid (BHA). Salicylic acid exfoliates not only the surface of
                  your skin but also inside the pore lining, thus allowing oil
                  to flow easily to the surface, so it doesn't get backed up and
                  plug the pore.

                <h2>Serums</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> A light, water-based serum is best for oily or
                  acne-prone skin, as too many rich plant oils can leave you
                  feeling greasy and lead to clogging.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Oily skin is often in need of moisture deep down to help
                  regulate the skin's production of natural oils called sebum,
                  so look for effective hydrators like hyaluronic acid and
                  glycerin (a great alternative to oils), plus vitamins A, C and
                  E.

                <h2>Moisturizing</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> The myth that oily skin doesn't need moisturiser is
                  pervasive. If you have oily skin, your skin isn't necessarily
                  well hydrated.<br />
                  <br /> Having an oily or combination skin type just means your
                  skin has a very effective barrier against attackers such as
                  germs and pollutants. Moisturizing is important for all skin
                  types & complexions.
                  <br />
                  <br />There are many moisturizing products that are created
                  especially for oily skin. These products are light, fast
                  absorbing, and don't leave your skin feeling like an oil
                  slick. Look for a moisturizer that's labeled non-comedogenic,
                  which means it won't clog pores.

                  <br />Finding the perfect sunscreen is tricky, and that's even
                  truer when you have oily skin — but they're not the best
                  sunscreens for oily skin or those prone to breakouts.
                  <br />
                  <br /> The best bet for oily skin types is sticking to light,
                  mattifying formulas that contain SPF 30 or higher and don't
                  contain preservatives, fragrances, lanolin, or other heavy
                  oils. Ingredients like niacinamide can even absorb excess
                  sebum, while dimethicone and hyaluronic acid can make skin
                  smoother and more matte, without drying it out.
