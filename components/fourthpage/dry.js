              <h3>What Is Dry Skin?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>‘Dry’ is used to describe a skin type that produces less sebum than normal skin.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a result of the lack of sebum, dry skin lacks the lipids that it needs to retain 
              moisture and build a protective shield against external influences. This leads to an impaired barrier function. 
              Dry skin (Xerosis) exists in varying degrees of severity and in different forms that 
              are not always clearly distinguishable.
              <br />
              <br />
              Significantly more women suffer from dry skin than men and all skin gets dryer as it ages. 
              Problems related to dry skin are a common complaint and account for 40% of visits to dermatologists.

                <p>
                  <br /> Dry skin is sensitive. It needs a cleanser that won't 
                          strip out its natural protective oils and emollients. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Typically a non-foaming cream-based cleanser is recommended when dealing with dryness.

                <h2>Exfoliating</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> When exfoliating dry skin, avoid mechanical exfoliation on dry skin, 
                  because the process is drying and it can lead to microtears. 
                  AHAs (and BHA's) are effective for dry skin.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This chemical exfoliants such as Glycolic acid will help remove dead cells 
                  sitting on the surface of the skin and encourage healthy skin turnover.

                  <br /> If you have dry skin, a incorporating a thirst-quenching 
                  serum into your routine is the best course of action if you're 
                  looking for tangible results. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Serums with hyaluronic acid and ceramides hold water in the skin and hydrate the 
                  skin the best. They hold 1000 times their weight in water, and as they are 
                  lightweight, they work well for all skin types

                  <br /> When Moisturizing dry skin, it is best to look for a moisturizer 
                        that is water-based and  contains hydrators which increase the skin's a
                        bility to hold water. Keeping your skin hydrated
                        is crucial when combating dryness. 
                  <br />
                  <br />Look for a moisturizer that containcs a humectant such as Hyalronic acid. You'll notice
                  that most products in a dry skin routine will incorporate Hyalronic acid as its an excellent hydrating
                  ingredient.

                  <br /> When you have dry skin, your main aim should be adding additional moisture. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Be on the lookout for ingredients that are hydrating and soothing for dry skin. Things like ceramides — which lock in moisture — and hyaluronic acid — which hydrates and plumps the skin — are awesome and much more common today than ever before. <br />
                  <br /> Likewise, antioxidants and healing plant extracts (think aloe vera, shea butter, and coffee seed) are highly effective for parched skin. You want to stay as close to all-natural as possible, as dry skin tends to get irritated by harsh alcohols, strong fragrances, and some preservatives.
