              <h3>What Is Combination Skin?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>Typically, the combination skin type is characterized by dry, 
              flaking skin on the cheeks, while excessive oil and shine appears on other areas 
              of the face, which is called the T-Zone.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are more sebaceous glands in the T-Zone, which are responsible for creating 
              sebum, the waxy substance that keeps your skin soft and supple. The glands in this 
              area tend to be more active in those with combination skin type, producing excess 
              sebum that can lead to shine and contribute to breakouts. If your mother or father 
              dealt with oily skin in the T-Zone, and battled acne, you’re apt to deal with this 
              condition as well.
              <br />
              <br />
              Combination skin is thought to be one of the most common skin types.

                <h2>Treating Combination Skin: Cleansing</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> Combination skin needs a facial cleanser that won't dry out your cheeks or exacerbate your oily T-zone 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If your main concern is acne and blackheads, look for a cleanser with salicylic acid or another exfoliant to clear 
                  away pore-clogging dead skin. If you're more worried about the drier skin on your face, try something that refreshes, 
                  protects, and soothes skin with ingredients like aloe, glycerin, and hydrating oils.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whatever your decide, gentle, non-comedogenic cleansers are always better choices for combination skin because if you 
                treat one of your skin's concerns too harshly, you risk upsetting the balance of the rest of your skin. Balance really 
                is the best way to keep any kind of combination skin happy and nourished.

                <h2>Exfoliating</h2>
                <p>
                  <br /> Combination skin requires something special because you're dealing with both dry and oily patches. Look for products that use fruit enzymes as the exfoliant.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                   Chemical exfoliants such as Lactic acid will help remove dead cells 
                  sitting on the surface of the skin and encourage healthy skin turnover.

                  combination skin, providing oil control and moisture without clogging pores, 
                  restoring balance to combination skin.

                <h2>Moisturizing</h2>
                <p>
            
                  <br />Those with combination skin know the difficulty of finding a moisturizer that works. 
                  Because some areas of the face are too dry and others are oily, many basic moisturizers can 
                  leave the T-zone prone to breakouts. So it’s important that one finds a lightweight, 
                  non-comedogenic moisturizer which won’t clog the pores.
                  <br />
                  <br />Focus on technique. Start by moisturizing only the dry areas, leaving the T-zone without moisturizer. 
                  For some people, a lightweight moisturizer like this will be enough to keep the skin hydrated after using a 
                  cleanser and applying toner. Another option, depending on how oily your skin appears, is to use two moisturizers: 
                  a lighter moisturizer for the T-zone and a thicker cream for the cheeks and dry areas.

                  <br />
                  Look for a Lightweight, and silky-smooth sunscreen that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.
